This README provides instructions on how to set up and run an Android Studio project downloaded from GitHub. 
Prerequisites:
- Android Studio: Download and install the latest version of Android Studio from the official website: https://developer.android.com/studio

Downloading as a ZIP and Opening in Android Studio
1. Download the Project:
Navigate to the desired project on GitHub.
Click on the "Code" button.
Select the "Download ZIP" option. This will download a compressed archive of the project files.

2. Extract the ZIP:
Use a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the downloaded ZIP file. This will create a folder containing the project files.
Open the Project in Android Studio:

3. Open Android Studio.
Go to File -> Open.
Select the extracted project folder on your computer.
Click "Open".

4. Install Dependencies (if needed):
Some projects might require additional libraries or dependencies to run. These are usually specified in a file named build.gradle.

If there are dependencies, Android Studio will usually prompt you to download them automatically.
If not, you can manually sync the project by going to File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.

5. Run the Project:

Make sure an Android emulator or physical device is connected and configured properly in Android Studio.
Click the "Run" button (usually a green play icon) in the toolbar.
Select the desired build variant (e.g., Debug) and your target device or emulator.
Click "OK" to start the project.
